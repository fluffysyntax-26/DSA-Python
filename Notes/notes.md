| Rule | Description | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Any assignment statements and if statements that are executed once regardless of the size of the problem | O(1) |
| 2 | A simple "for" loop from 0 to n (with no internal loops) | O(n) |
| 3 | A nested loop of the same type takes quadratic time complexity | O(n^2) |
| 4 | A loop, in which the controlling parameter is divided by two at each step | O(log n) |
| 5 | When dealing with multiple statements, just add them up | |
